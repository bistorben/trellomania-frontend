# Project for Learning and Application Purposes

As part of my training to become a full-stack web developer (MERN stack) at DCI, I developed this project over the course of seven weeks. Using Trello as a template, I implemented the following key features. This repository contains the frontend of the application. You can find the backend repository here: [Backend Repository](https://github.com/bistorben/trellomania-backend).

## Key Features

- **Board Management**: Create and share boards  
- **List Management**: Add, move, and remove lists within a board  
- **Card Management**: Create, move, and delete cards  
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Move cards between lists using drag & drop  
- **User Authentication**: Sign-up/Login with JSON Web Token (JWT)  
- **Protected Routes**: Only authenticated users can access boards
