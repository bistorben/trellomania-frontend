# Project for learning and application purposes

As part of our training with the Digital Career Institute (DCI) to become a full stack web developer, we are building a Trello-like application in the MERN stack for the final project over a period of approx. 7 weeks.

Trello serves as a source of inspiration and a rough design template.
