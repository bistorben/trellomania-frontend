# Project for learning and application purposes

As part of our training with the Digital Career Institute (DCI) to become a full stack web developer, we are building a Trello-like application in the MERN stack for the final project over a period of approx. 7 weeks.

Trello serves as a source of inspiration and a rough design template.

We are slowly looking around on the job market, please contact us if you are interested or have any questions.

YEAH!
